<h1>Snub-nosed monkey </h1>
<p>
Snub-nosed monkeys live in Asia, with a range covering southern China (especially Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou) <br> 
extending into the northern parts of Myanmar and Vietnam. <br>
Snub-nosed monkeys inhabit mountain forests up to elevations of more than 4,000 m (13,000 ft). <br>
They have rich golden brown to golden red fur, and the tail is about the same length as the body. <br>
There are some 8,000 to 10,000 golden snub-nosed monkeys in the wild, and they are not in immediate danger of extinction <br>
</p>
<p>
    The scientific name refers to Roxellana, consort of the Ottoman sultan SÃ¼leyman the Magnificent, <br> 
    who had reddish gold hair and, by some accounts, a snub nose. <br>
    Other than the golden snub-nosed monkey, there are the black snub-nosed monkey, <br>
    the tonkin stub nosed monkey, and the myanmar snub-nosed monkey. <br>
    The diet of these animals consists mainly of tree needles, bamboo buds, fruits and leaves. <br>
    They have a gestation period of 200 days which is 80 days shorter than humans.
