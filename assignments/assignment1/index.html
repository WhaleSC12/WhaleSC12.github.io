    <h1>Snub-nosed Monkeys</h1>
    <p>
        Snub-nosed monkeys live in Asia, with a range covering southern China (especially Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou), 
        extending into the northern parts of Myanmar and Vietnam. 
        Snub-nosed monkeys inhabit mountain forests up to elevations of more than 4,000 m (13,000 ft). 
        They have rich golden brown to golden red fur, and the tail is about the same length as the body. 
        There are some 8,000 to 10,000 golden snub-nosed monkeys in the wild, and they are not in immediate danger of extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scientific name refers to Roxellana, consort of the Ottoman sultan SÃ¼leyman the Magnificent, 
        who had reddish gold hair and, by some accounts, a snub nose. 
        Other than the golden snub-nosed monkey, there are the black snub-nosed monkey, 
        the Tonkin stub-nosed monkey, and the Myanmar snub-nosed monkey. 
        The diet of these animals consists mainly of tree needles, bamboo buds, fruits, and leaves. 
        They have a gestation period of 200 days, which is 80 days shorter than humans.
