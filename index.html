Hello portia csce 242
<br>
“Forward, the Light Brigade!”
<br>
Was there a man dismayed?
<br>
Not though the soldier knew
<br>
   Someone had blundered.
   <br>
   Theirs not to make reply,
   <br>
   Theirs not to reason why,
   <br>
   Theirs but to do and die.
   <br>
   Into the valley of Death
   <br>
   Rode the six hundred.
